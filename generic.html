													<p> This web application looks at COVID-19 metrics on a county-by-county level in order to gauge which pockets of the United States are at the highest risk. 
													All data is recorded and visualized in real-time by querying from the New York Times' GitHub repository. 
													Furthermore, I also perform a novel clustering analysis of each and every county in the United States according to some user-specified metrics.

														<p>This web application was made with my friends as part of the Texas A&M University 2020 Datathon. 
														Our final product was a heroku web application to gauge the best city for a user based on specified metrics and sklearn's davies_bouldin_score attribute. 
														After gauging the optimal "home(s)" for a user, we visualized these locations and used web-scraping to display images of a user's ideal city. 
														We won 3rd place in our category.</p>

														<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/test-77cc88c7829f" class="image fit"><img src="images/fire.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
														<p>I wrote a comprehensive article for DataRes at UCLA that looks at California wildfire growth over the last few years, and the role climate change has played in exacerbating the current wildfire crisis. 
														What amazed me while writing this article was how a select few number of counties in California account for so much of the annual wildfire destruction.
														All visualizations were created from scratch using CAL FIRE data/APIs.</p>

														<p>In this project my team built a virtual assistant to convey COVID-19 information audibly and over SMS. 
														We noticed a gap in catering for those with visual impairments and addressed this issue with the tremendous capabilities of speech recognition. 
														We essentially created a virtual assistant that can perform a variety of tasks. These tasks range from answering questions about the virus using an AI-powered chatbot, to enabling quick-and-easy 
														dissemination of real-time COVID-19 county-specific updates. </p>

                            <p>The aim of this datathon was to gather eCommerce insights and leverage analytics to diagnose business strengths in terms of customer behaviors.
			    My team was charged with analyzing visualizations that projected customer lifetime value (LTV) over 5 year and 10 year periods. 
			    By analyzing specific quantiles of our subset, we came to the conclusion that our client (the eCommerce company in question) should target higher spenders and 
			    incentivize to those customers who fall in the top 60% of high-spenders. We won 2nd place overall. </p>

                            <p>In an effort to better understand how powerful search engines such as Google function, I built the skeleton of the PageRank algorithm from scratch. 
			    Having created this algorithm I used it to recognize important characters in the famous Broadway Play, Hamilton, as well as the most frequented 
		            airports across the globe. PageRank expresses an intuitive idea: important pages are linked to other important pages. As such, I look at how often a 
			    character is mentioned by another character in Hamilton and how often a specific airport is visited in the context of departures/arrivals. </p>
